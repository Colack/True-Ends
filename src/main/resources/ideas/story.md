She introduces herself as Pheonix Edward Eris, and tells him that he is in a place called the 'In-Between', a place that exists between the world of the conscious and the world of the subconscious.
SHe tells him that he has been chosen to be a 'Truth Seeker', someone who can see the truth behind the lies, and that he has the power to change the world.

J.Z. is confused, but intrigued, and decides to go along with Pheonix. She tells him that she can grant him immense power, but that he must make a deal with her.
J.Z. agrees, and Pheonix shows him a vision of the world, a world that is filled with lies and deceit, a world that is on the brink of destruction.
She then touches J.Z.'s chest, and pulls out a book, a book that contains his fate, and the story of his life.

She shows that most of the pages are blank, and tells him that he has the power to write his own story, to change the world, and to save it from destruction.
She tells him that in his city, there are people who are catalysts of lies and deceit, and that he must find them and expose them for who they truly are.
By doing this, he can change the fate of the world, and save it from destruction.

She turns to the latest page in the book, and shows him that it has a area for him to sign his name, and that by signing it, he will be bound to the book.
She says she will grant him the power to see the truth, and to change the world, but in return, he must help her with her research, and help study the world of the conscious and the subconscious.

J.Z. asks her what she means by 'helping her with her research', and she tells him that she is a 'Truth Seeker' as well, but that in the past, something went wrong, and she is now trapped in the In-Between.
So she looks for people who can help her with her research, and help her find a way to escape the In-Between.

J.Z. is hesitant, but agrees to help her, and signs his name in the book.

Pheonix smiles, and tells him that he has made the right choice, and that he will now be able to see the truth behind the lies, and change the world.
J.Z. suddenly feels a pulsating feeling in his chest, and then everything goes black.

When he wakes up, he finds himself back in the real world, and is met by the bullies who are about to attack him again.

This time, however, J.Z. is different, he is no longer afraid, and he can see the truth behind the lies.
He hears Pheonix's voice in his head, telling him to simply call out the truth, and manifest it into reality.

J.Z. does so, and he falls to the ground, suddenly feeling immense power, nausea, and a sense of dread.
Hearing a voice in his head, this time different, telling him that he now has the power to change the world, and that he will help him achieve his goals.

From J.Z.'s chest, a strange symbol appears, and he manifests his fighting spirit into a physical form.

Standing up, he faces the bullies, and tells them that he knows the truth behind their lies, and that they will pay for what they have done.
J.Z. is then taken to the world of the subconscious, where he must fight the bullies in a turn-based RPG battle.

After heading home, J.Z. is met by his empty house, and is greeted by his grandmother, who is a kind and caring old lady.
She asks him how his day was, and J.Z. tells her that he had a strange experience, but that he is okay.

She tells him that she will always be there for him, and that she loves him very much.

J.Z. then goes to his room, and decides that he will head off to bed, as he is tired from the day's events.

As he falls asleep, he wakes up in the In-Between, where he is met by Pheonix, who tells him that he has made the right choice, and that he will now be able to see the truth behind the lies, and change the world.
She says "That Maverick seems like a interesting person, I believe he will be crucial in your journey."
She then offers the player a choice, to either continue with the story, or to wake up and continue with their life.

She says "The choice is yours, J.Z., you can either continue from here, but never be able to go back to the way things were..."
She says "Or you can wake up, and continue with your life, right when the bullies knocked you out."

The player is then given a choice, to either continue with the story, or to wake up and continue with their life.

If the player chooses to continue with the story, they wake up and find themselves back in the real world, with their grandmother calling them for breakfast.
If the player chooses to wake up and continue with their life, the game ends, and the player is given the option to start a new game or exit.
